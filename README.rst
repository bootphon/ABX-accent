ABX-accent 
==============
The ABX-accent, project based of the preparation and the evaluation of Accented English Speech Recognition Challenge (AESRC) data, using `ABXpy <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/>`_ for the evaluation,We provide in our github repository all the necessary elements for the preparation and evaluation process.

The ABXpy metric evaluate for a pair of sounds representations (A,B) from for example (”bap”,”bop”), the probability that the representation X of another instance of the sound ”bap” is closer to A than B. ABX error rate is computed by averaging over all the minimal pairs of phone trigram in the corpus. 
In this benchmark we focus on the harder ABX across speaker metric, which uses X instances from a different speaker than the one of the pair(A,B).

The `Accented English Speech Recognition Challenge (AESRC) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10233>`_ consists of ten english accents: American, British, Canadian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian.

Start the project
-------------------
All you need to get started to work on the development data and evaluation for AESRC is a:

- preparation and evaluation softwares.
- `The results data <https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/data>`_ after the preparation and the evaluation process.

The setup procedure is described for Linux. It has been tested on several distributions (Ubuntu 16.04, Debian Jessie and CentOS 6). It should work as well on MacOS.

Organisation
------------
( The preparation data and the data results after the evaluation.
