Data preparation
================
 
- `Split data scripts <https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts/prepare/splits>`_ : scripts used to splits the AESRC dataset, on six Female and six Male with two hours of speech for ABX and 2min for adatptation for each accent.  
- `Abkhazia <https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts/prepare/abkhazia>`_ : once we split the dataset, we prepare it with using Abkhazia.
