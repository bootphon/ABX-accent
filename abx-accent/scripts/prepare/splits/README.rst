**Data splits**

- **Gender_split** : split the subdatset of each accent to Female and Male List.

  -  `The script <https://github.com/bootphon/AESRC/edit/main/bin/prepare/splits/aesrc_gender_split.py>`_ used for gender split/
  - `The result <https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/data/prepare/data_splits>`_ after spliting the dataset.
  
- **Sub_dataset** : take only a part of the dataset for each speaker (example; for each speaker take 10min for abx and 2min for adaptation study).

  - The `script <https://github.com/bootphon/AESRC/edit/main/bin/prepare/splits/aesrc_subdataset_split.py>`_ used to reorganise the dataset on subdatasets 
  - The final `result <https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/data/prepare/data_splits>`_.
