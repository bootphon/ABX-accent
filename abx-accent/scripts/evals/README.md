- [H5features](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts/evals/generate_abx_score/h5features): the features can be calculated in numpy via external tools, and made compatible with this package with the `h5features module`.
      - `generate_features_files.py`, generate the `h5_file.h5f`file on each input dataset.
    
- [Item files]() : generate the item files that will be used on ABX.scripts used are on this `section 
    - 
- [Task module](https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/ABXpy.html#task-module), is
    used for creating a new task and preprocessing.
- `Distances package
    <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/ABXpy.distances.html>`_ is
    used for calculating the distances necessary for the score
    calculation.

- `Score module
    <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/ABXpy.html#score-module>`_
    is used for computing the score of a task.

- `Analyze module
    <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/ABXpy.html#analyze-module>`_
    is used for analysing the results.
    
- `Score average <https://github.com/bootphon/AESRC/results/average>`_ ,to generate the score average.
