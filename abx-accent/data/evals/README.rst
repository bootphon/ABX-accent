Data evaluation
===============
To evaluate the data after the preparation stage (see `the Data Preparation section <https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/data/prepare>`_), we follow these steps: 

- ``Item_files``:
Required input files for the ABXpy evaluation.

- ``ABXpy tasks``:
We compute the scores for both across-speaker and within-speaker tasks using ABXpy.

- ``Average scores``:
The average ABX score is calculated for each accent and for each dataset (dev/test).
