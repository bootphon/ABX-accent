Data evaluation
===============
To evaluate the Data after the preparation (see `this section <https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/data/prepare>`_), we move to the evaluation part and for that, we have steps:

- Item_files, that we need for ABXpy.
- ABXpy tasks, we generated the score for both across and within tasks.
- Average score, we calculate the abx score average for each accent of each set.
