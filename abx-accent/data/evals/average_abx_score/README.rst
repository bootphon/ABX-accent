Average Score
=============

We calculate the average ABX task scores for each dataset:

- ``dev/`` : Contains average scores for all accents in the development set, for both across-speaker and within-speaker tasks.

- ``test/`` :  Contains average scores for all accents in the test set, also for both tasks.


Example:

``across : { 0.6398370918533675 }``
``within : { 0.7665211843399248 }``
