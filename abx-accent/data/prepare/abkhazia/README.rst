Forced alignment
----------------
Do phone-level forced alignment on your own corpus of annotated audio files.
Follow the steps on the `docs <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/abkhazia/abkhazia_force_align.html>`_.

- **dev** : contains the forced alignment results `dev_accent_align.txt` for each accent for dev set. 
   
  Example file: `dev_american_align.txt` contains the forced alignment output for American accent. 

- **test** : contains the AF results `test_accent_align.txt` for each accent for test set. 
  
  Example file: `test_american_align.txt` contains the forced alignment output for American accent.
