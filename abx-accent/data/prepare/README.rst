Data prepare
=============

- To prepare the data, we need to split the dataset according to the sets , the number of speakers and the speech duration we want on our study.
On this repository we give the filename and speakers list used to get the given results.
- Use Abkhazia to prepare the dataset.
- Generate the forced alignment files, following the setup on the script folder.
