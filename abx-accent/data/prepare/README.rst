Data prepare
=============
- Split the dataset according to the study sets, the number of speakers and the speech duration we want on the study.
On this repository we give the filename and speakers list used to get the given results.
- Use Abkhazia to prepare the dataset.
- Generate the forced alignment files, following the setup on the script folder.
