ABX-accent 
==============
All you need to get started to work on the development data and evaluation for The Accented English Speech Recognition Challenge is:

- Prepare the development data (AESRC).
- Evaluation software setup.

The setup procedure is described for Linux. It has been tested on several distributions (Ubuntu 16.04, Debian Jessie and CentOS 6). It should work as well on MacOS.
 

Organisation
------------

The main modules and other submodules.

**Data prepare**

- `Data splits <https://github.com/bootphon/AESRC/results/splits>`
   split the AESRC data on; test and dev sets consist in two hours of speech within 12 speakers, 
   including six Females and six Males using for ABX and 2minutes from each  speaker for adaptation.
   All the data from the other speakers is included into the train set.
   Speakers from the dev and test sets are disjoints from those of the training set.      
   Scripts used on this `section <https://github.com/bootphon/AESRC/bin/prepare/splits>`_.
  
Once we split the dataset to test,dev and train, we do the :

- `Abkhazia 
  <https://github.com/bootphon/abkhazia/tree/aesrc>`_
  makes it easy to obtain simple baselines for
  supervised ASR (using `Kaldi <http://kaldi-asr.org>`_) and ABX tasks
  (using `ABXpy <https://github.com/bootphon/ABXpy>`_).
   
  After validating the corpus to check that it is conform to Kaldiâ€™s input format, we go to the splits step:
  
- `Forced Alignment <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/abkhazia/abkhazia_force_align.html>`_, follow the steps in the link to do phone-level forced alignment on your own corpusof annotated audio files.
  
**Evals**

- `H5features
  <http://h5features.readthedocs.org/en/latest/h5features.html>`_ 
  The features can be calculated in numpy via external tools, and made compatible with this package with the `h5features module`.
  scripts used are on this `section <https://github.com/bootphon/AESRC/bin/evals/h5f>`_.
  
- `Item files` 
  generate the item files that will be used on ABX.Scripts used are on this `section <https://github.com/bootphon/AESRC/bin/evals/items>`_.

- `Task module
  <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/ABXpy.html#task-module>`_ is
  used for creating a new task and preprocessing.

- `Distances package
  <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/ABXpy.distances.html>`_ is
  used for calculating the distances necessary for the score
  calculation.

- `Score module
  <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/ABXpy.html#score-module>`_
  is used for computing the score of a task.

- `Analyze module
  <https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/ABXpy.html#analyze-module>`_
  is used for analysing the results.
  
- `Score average <https://github.com/bootphon/AESRC/results/average>`_ ,to generate the score's average.
