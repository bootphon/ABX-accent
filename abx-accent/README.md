ABX-accent 
=============
To get started the abx_accent project, you need two main steps: 

- Prepare the development AESRC data.
- Evaluation software setup.
 
Organisation
------------

The main modules and other submodules.

**[Scripts](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts)**
: contains all the scripts you need for each step.

- [Prepare scripts](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts/prepare), scripts used to prepare the dataset:
 
  - [Data split scipts](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts/prepare/splits), after getting the AESRC dataset, we have to split it following three main steps:
   - sets split (test/dev/train): split this dataset of the ten accent has on training set, a dev and a test set, each containing different speakers.
   - speakers and gender split: balancing for male and female speakers, with six Female and six Male for (test/dev) and the rest for train set.
   - speech duration: 10 min for each speaker on (test and dev) sets, which is 2 hours of audio speech on total and that will be used for ABX. The dev and test set provide for each speaker a 2min adaptation set. The rest of the data used for train.
  - [Abkhazia software](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts/prepare/abkhazia): provides a standard format for the dataset, used for ABXpy.
  
- [Evals softwares](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts/prepare), scripts used for the evaluation process:
 
  - [ABXpy package](https://github.com/bootphon/ABXpy), is used  for computing the scores of two tasks (across and within tasks) for (test/dev) sets.
  - [abx score average](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/scripts/eval/average), is used to calculate the average of the abx score for each task (across/within). This is using to compare between the dev/test average for each task and the other process used for training set.#TBD 


**[Data](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/data)**, on this repository, we have also two main modules:

- [Data prepare](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/data/prepare)

  - [Data split](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/data/prepare/data_splits), to resume all the splits, you have two general files (abx_files.csv and adapt_files.csv), for each one you have the list of the filename, with it is own information (accent: one of the ten accents, study:abx or adapt, speaker: which speaker, gender:Male or Female), you can use it to rebuild the sets used to get the results on this repository.

  - [Abkhazia](https://github.com/bootphon/abkhazia/tree/aesrc) uses the sets after the split step to obtain the standard format for the dataset and then validate the corpus to check that it is conformed to Kaldi’s input format.

  - [Forced Alignment](https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/abkhazia/abkhazia_force_align.html), use the dataset after the preparation to do phone-level forced alignment. If everything went right, you should be able to find your alignment in `corpus/align/alignments.txt`.

- [Data evals](https://github.com/bootphon/ABX-accent/tree/main/abx-accent/data/evals), after preparation the dataset on (test/dev) sets, we used ABXpy to evaluate the prepared dataset.

  - [The ABXpy task](https://docs.cognitive-ml.fr/ABXpy/ABXpy.html#task-module), contains two subfolders (across_task /within_task)each contains the abx task result.

  - [Abx score average](https://github.com/bootphon/AESRC/results/average), the average of ABxpy task scores for each accent.
